					Edgar Allan Poe (/poʊ/; born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) 
					was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his 
					poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. 
					He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States 
					and of American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest 
					practitioners of the short story. He is generally considered the inventor of the
					detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging 
					genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to earn 
					a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.
